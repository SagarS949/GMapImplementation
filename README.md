# GMapImplementation
Implementing the idea of google maps using GRAPH data structure

Our application helps in finding:
	1. the location of the user,
	2. the location of the destination,
	3. and thereby the most efficient route between source and destination.

Additional Points:
	1. The vertices of the graph denote the locations and the edges of the graph denote the roads between the vertices.
	2. Distance and time taken to travel between two vertices would be the weights of the edges in the graph.
	3. Efficient route between the source and destination is found accounting to the distance and time taken.

Implementation is done in C++.
